    <h1>Experience</h1>
    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <p>Trainee Cloud Engineer - Jan 2024 - April 2024</p>
    <p>I enrolled in Northcoders boot camp as it provides me with not only the 
        knowledge in technical skills to be a successful software/cloud engineer but 
        also teaches me how to work in an environment like that of a high-intensity 
        workplace by providing me with experience with essential technical and 
        non-technical skills required to successfully work in a software environment. 
        I have completed a solo and team project during the boot camp teaching me 
        all the requirements of working solo and within a team.
    </p>

    <p>Led a team of lifeguards in a fast-paced environment taking on great 
        challenges and delivering excellent customer service.
        Applying myself to my job has helped me develop and build upon several 
        key skills, such as teamwork, leadership, communication, organisation, and 
        working under pressure.
