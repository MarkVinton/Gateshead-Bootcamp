        An object is a representation of an element in HTML and CSS these bjects are the elements on your webpage for example div and p etc.
        They can have properties and methods that can allow the user to interact with them.

        A property is a characteristic of an object which defines the state or the detail of the object.
        For an example an img object has the property src which defines the source of the image.

        A method is either an action or funtion that can be performed on an object allwoing you to dynamically interat or change on object.

        Client side scripting is code that os executed in only the user's browser and is effective 
        in creating an interactive and dynamic user experience. Although it can reduce serber load it is 
        less secure as the source is visible to the user.

        Server side scripting is code that is exectued on the actual web server and is effective in
        creating dynamic web pages and applications. It is more secure as the source code is not visible.
